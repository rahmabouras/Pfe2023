But the real innovation lies in our application, which offers wireless communication between the main boat and the tender boat for light fishing. The application allows fishermen to consult in real time the GPS position of the tender, the sonar, the working status of the lights, as well as the voltage and the input current during the charge.
 Our application also offers the possibility to trigger an alarm in case of problem or danger, as well as to save a sonar image manually with the date, GPS position and weather status to create a database.","Eskander AlayaAhmed BACCOUCHChaima GRIRA","eskander-al@hotmail.com","28695169"
